# Visit Westminster
https://stackedit.io/app#

# Introduction

The site is to be appealing so the rule of thirds was used where possible and appropriate colours and fonts were used.



# Files

The site is composed of three types of file as follows:

 - .html files, these are the actual pages
 - Image files. There are a few different image types although they have all been optimised
 - CSS file. This containes styling for the HTML pages

The HTML files are in the root directory, the other files are in the assets folder. The assets folder itself contains two subdirectories, one containing all the images (called images) and the other containing the images (called images).

# Technical Background

The site was to have three pages and these were decided to be “Home”, “Links” and “FAQ and Contact”. 

# Technologies used

Only HTML and CSS were allowed and the site had to be fully responsive. Bootstrap 5 was used to make the site resposive, in particular its flexbox and grid technologies and capabilities. Several Bootstrap methods were used as they improved the appearance of the site.

Some Bootstrap classes use Java Script but, as this was invisible to the programmer, it was allowed.

The head of each page contains meta tags to help the site to be found and improve its rankings in search results.

The project was developed and hosted on Github from several locations using different computers. 

## Requirements and Installation
The site only requires six HTML pages and one style page to be hosted. Any additional support is called from scripts in those pages.

## Layout
The layout was designed using a wireframe making sure the main features of the site were the following:
 - Eye and attention catching
 - Visually appealing
 - Easily accessible for anyone and easy to use and navigate

During the designI made an effort to make sure to implement the Surface, Skeleton, Structure, Scope, and Strategy planes and this produced a framework which was very helpful in designing the site.

Following this a wireframe of the original design idea was prepared and is shown below. 

Colour is important and was decided using judgement rather than by consulting Internet palettes. As there are so many images on the site only understated colours were used. The page backgrounds are grey and with some panels being white text on black backgrounds and others being different shades of grey and blue grey. These do not distract from the plentiful images and give the site authority. The footer, however, has a coral background to prompt visitors to read all the way down to the foot of the page.

These colours were also selected for a technical reason. The site can be viewed on a phone and darker backgrounds will drain the battery less without losing any visual appeal.

The site was also viewed as it would be seen by someone with Protanopia and someone with Deuteranopia (colour blindnesses). The images appear differently but all the text, links and instructions were clearly visible.

The screen reader tags were all filled in and can be followed and read by screen readers.

## Wireframe
A wireframe was created, as mentioned above, and the design for each page is reproduced below.

## Design Consideratons

As visitors have many temptations to jump to other sites and links it is essential to keep them engaged at all times. The main methods of doing this are:
 - Design
 - Layout
 - Message

The design of each page will be considered in the section which has a detailed analysis of each page. One of the overall design considerations is wich font to use. Following convention one font was used for headings and another for text. Actually coosing the actual fonts was easy. 

As sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read than serif fonts on computer screens sthey were used for headings. Some advantages of serif fonts such as looking elegant, and trustworthy and being confident were conveyed by the font in the longer text where serif fonts were used.

The choice of actual font was largely left to the legendary designer Massimo Vignelli who said "In the new computer age, the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest."

He also designed the signage for the New York subway and did much other timeless work so I simply used one of his preferred sans serif fonts for headings and one of his preferred serif fonts for the text which is short so visitors are unlikely to leave having gone that far.

Vignelli also said "The life of a designer is a life of fight: fight against the ugliness" and as there is so much class and beauty in Westminster, fighting ugliness was not difficult. Although not mentioned in the site there were 1,968 rough sleepers in Westminster making it the London borough with the highest number of rough sleepers in 2021/22. 

Images were easy to find as Westminster has so many famous sites and such a rich history. Most images were downloaded from Pexels.com although some were downloaded from other sites which allowed them to be used and one was downloaded from Adobe who allowed some free images in the first month of membership. or video, graphic or sound files appear on the site.

The three pages produced were a home page, a links page and a contact and FAQ page and were produced for the following reasons:
 - Every site needs a home page
 - As three pages is nowhere near adequate for a site about Westminster it was decided to have a links page leading to other sites with more information about special things in Westminster. Links pages are no longer in fashion so it was implemented in a different way, by having pictures of attractions set up as links.
 - The European Court of Justice has decided electronic contact forms can comply with the E-commerce Directive so a form was put on the FAQ and Contacts page to be compliant and to enable a different technology to be used. That page also has an accordion with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) both to show proficiency with a new technology and to enable a lot of textual information to be contained without intimidating the visitor with a visuql barrage of text.

## Detailed Analysis Of Each Page

**Parts Common To Each Page**
Each page has the same header and footer. The header "logo" was taken from the [Westminster City Council](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/) and put on a transparent background. 

The "Visit Westminster" title is an h1 and the navigation icons on theleft are adapted from a Bootstrap navbar.

The footers were also adapted from a Bootstrap footer. They contain links to terms and privacy pages which are only accessible from the footers and cannot be reached by the navbar. 

The footers also contain copyright and publisher information and the opposite side has a link to the top of the page. This was more to provide visual balance than because it is needed although it might be helpful on smaller screens. The footers also contain links to the Bootstrap and other scripts that are not in the CSS file.

The centre of the footer bears social icons which are links the home page of each site and open in a new browser tab so as not to lose the visitor.

**Home Page** 
The home page uses a carousel in order to attract attention by having images moving and, once a visitor had seen a picture change, they would be likely to wait to see what the next picture is and then become more interested in the site.

One of the pictures is the Abbey Road street sign which most people are acquainted with and will attract the attention of people scanning sites. Another is a picture of the Westminster station sign with the Queen Elizabeth Towere (Big Ben) in the background. The third image is of a group of Bearskins which always draws attention.

These were delivered using the carousel from [the Bootstrap 5 website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/#how-it-works) and no additional images were added as three was enough. There is no hero image as such as the three carousel images are attention seeking. For those who are not attracted by them there is a picture of Margaret Thatcher below it which promotes a reaction in most people. She is mentioned not because of her politics but because of her contribution to ice cream manufacture. As an aside she did enormous damage to the UK dairy industry by closing the Milk Marketing Board. 

On one side of Margaret Thatcer there is a picture of a good looking dog which I had used as a placeholder when constructing the site and whom I did not have the heart to delets. Luckily I managed to make up something about how dog lovers can visit the borough.

On the other side there is a night time view of the Palace of Westminster from accross the Thames which is recognised by almost everyone as one of the sights of London.

The carousel tself is flanked by texts, one of which gives a few of the Westminster attractions and the other gives a very brief history of the borough.

Below Margaret Thatcher there is a group of three cards, the central one containing an image of the late Queen in a horsedrawn carriage in a state event and someinteresting facts on either side for visual balance.

At the foot of the page, above the footer, there is, on the full screen display, some text saying how easy it is to get to and from Westminster and an image of a Westminster roundel. The image distorts when it is on smaller screens  so it does not show then. 

elow the text there is a button opening a link to a new browser tab opening Google Maps at Trafalgar Square, 

**Links Page**
This has the same header and footer as the other pages with the active page in the navbar appropriately amended.

Below this there is a well emphasised piece of text ensuring visitors know how to reach the links and that the sites linked to are not the responsibility of the publisher.

The links are almost all images in a [Masonry display](https://masonry.desandro.com/) with some text below them which also link to the same target. It would have been possible for the image, the subtitle and the text each to be linked to a different target but explaining this would have been too complicated so they all link to the same place.

**The Style Page**
The styling not controlled by Bootstrap is generated in a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) page  

**404 Page**
A 404 page was constructed which has an optimised image and some text all of which are linked back to the home page. If a visitor should end up at the 404 page clicking almost anywhere will take them to the home page.

**Minor Pages**
Links to a privacy page and a terms page were put on the footer. Each of these pages is boilerplate taken from Internet sources which are only there for the sake of completeness.

## Further Improvements
The site can easily be improved by adding additional pages covering additional topics. Topics that would benefit the site inlude
 - An email address and maybe a phone number for enquiries although there is a form
 - Information for anyone moving to Westminster
 - Information for anyone visiting Westminster
 - lists of businesses serving the area such as builders, estate agents, restaurants, markets shops andsoe of the other information those moving to Westminster might need
 - Additionally there could be similar images for visitors including boarding establishments, tour guides, bureaux de change and other useful information
 - A technical shortcoming of the site is that the carousel gets very small when the viewport gets to the Bootstrap small breakpoint. In a further iteration the layout from this breakdown would be altered to give a better view of the carousel from this breakpoint

parts of the page which are partly styled by CSS and a footer containing links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions and an anchor tag taking visitors to the top of the page.

## CONCLUSION**

**

o Bootstrap 5 was used to make the site responsive and, although it uses Java Script, this is allowed as the JS coding is all included in the Bootstrap files.

o The Bootstrap files are derived from a CDN which is referenced on the website pages.

o Bootstrap icons were used as Bootstrap was being used to make the site responsive.

o The links on the links page are composed in a Masonry wall constructed within Bootstrap. The images, descriptions and subtitles all link to one target as directing them to different targets, although possible, would have required too much textual explanation.

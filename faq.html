                        after booking is not possible.

                        If you are booking a bulky waste collection with a concession request (for example if you are
                        receiving Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support), once you have booked the collection online
                        our booking team will aim to call you back within two working days. The team will then advise
                        you of the next available collection slot and your collection will be made within three days.
                        Adding or removing items after booking is not possible.

                        Please let us know your availability for a call-back during office hours, 9am to 5pm.</p>
